<BR>
<BR>lesson 1
<BR>
<BR>-lightbot (a programming game)
<BR>Learn the basics of programming
<BR>Procedural instructions
<BR><a href=http://lightbot.com/hocflash.html>Click here to play lightbot</a>
<BR>
<BR>-Scratch
<BR>Note: I am a dyslexic, so if you find spelling mistakes, please bear with it...  they don't really affect the programs themselves
<BR>
<BR>Note: this is not a tutorial on how to use scratch, it is an introduction to programming that happens to use scratch as a tool to make it easy to get used to the basics of programming(while avoiding certain problems called "syntax errors" and "compiler errors"). We will not go into depth on how to use Scratch itself
<BR> 
<BR>Note: Completed exercise projects are marked with a **, it is not recommended you click “look inside" until after you finish making them yourself but you may execute the program to see what the output should be like.
<BR>
<BR>Note: if you finished your project before others you will become a "deputy teacher" and help the others understand what they are doing. But don't do their work for them please.
<BR>
<BR>Note: make your own Scratch account so you can save your work on the cloud
<BR>Note: when you are ready to write your own solution to a problem, either click on<a href=http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/>Solve problem online</a> or use the scratch offline editor which you can <a href=http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/>download by clicking here</a>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>Algorithms
<BR>An Algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions that work towards achieving a specific goal or solving a problem
<BR>the difference between an algorithm and a program is that a program is coded for a computer to follow, and an algorithm can be followed by a person…. I am thinking of bringing a set of cards and have the students sort them using insertion-sort
<BR>every program is an algorithm.
<BR> for example, a cooking recipe is an algorithm. lets now sort a deck of cards using insert sort.  
<BR>
<BR>Computer Science focuses more on algorithms  than Software Engineering does.

<BR>
<BR>lesson 7
<BR>functions(blocks) 
<BR>Why Functions?
<BR>Make your code more readable, by braking it into blocks
<BR>You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
<BR>You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
<BR>When you are writing a program and you seem to be repeating stuff, it should be a function. 
<BR>
<BR>Examples:
<BR>Add function
